# Off-by-one Error in Dart List Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart when iterating over a list using a `for` loop.  The error arises from incorrectly handling the loop's termination condition, leading to an `IndexOutOfRangeException`.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides the corrected version.  The issue is explained in detail in the comments within the code.

This example highlights the importance of careful index management when working with lists and arrays in programming.
